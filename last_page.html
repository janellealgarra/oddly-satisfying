        In the genres of things that didn’t exist before the internet age, photos and videos tagged as “oddly satisfying” are up there with both the exceptionally weird, and overwhelmingly wonderful. A term born out of reddit as an attempt to describe the inexplicably pleasing quality that watching some mundane thing could rouse in its viewer, oddly satisfying videos encompass everything from watching pressure washers clean pavements to marbled cake glazing and industrial machines cutting through ice. Other concoctions quickly began to appear such as kinetic sand slicing, soap cutting, paint mixing, and there are just as many videos using cake, sponge, liquid metal, icing – whatever materials that are malleable enough to make it a satisfying watch.
        Whether it’s pouring, cutting, washing, mixing or slicing, an entire ecosystem of these videos has surfaced, hypnotising the internet in a technicolour dream of instant satisfaction. Which got me wondering, what exactly is it about oddly satisfying videos that make them, well, so oddly satisfying?

      <h3>visually congruent, a childlike focus, and cinematicity of the everyday</h3>

        What these newer videos have in common (aside from the lurid colours and excessive glitter) is a deliberate recreation of visually congruous elements that have no real utility other than to satisfy its viewers. It is purposeful where others before were accidental, but it is also creative.
        “There is something about finding congruence in visual stimuli that seems to be the value,” says Allocca. “I think people are starting to understand that there is an art to creating things that are oddly satisfying.”

        But most interesting, is that young, digitally-equipped people are watching these videos before they go to bed to help them sleep. Because of this, there have been numerous reports that watching videos of slime and other things under the oddly satisfying umbrella help make people feel relaxed and calm, which has led to some conjecture as to whether the “oddly satisfying” is in fact another branch of ASMR.
        It can be argued that the oddly satisfying has seen a surge in popularity driven by younger audiences because younger people are exposed to screen time earlier, and so do not come across the tactile oddly satisfying experiences in their everyday in the physical realm.

        It’s a generation finding relief in watching the playful manipulation of materials, the oddly satisfying for just a moment holds the promise of perfection, of beautifully controlled chaos.
         Whether it’s getting that ball of paper in the trash can the first time round, cutting that cake just right or taking a moment to watch your barista artfully swirl the milk at the top of your latte, it may be easier than you think to find the oddly satisfying in your everyday. Which, after all, is an oddly satisfying thought in itself.
